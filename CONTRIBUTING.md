Feel free to contribute if you have anything to add. Please create an issue while your working on it (also assign yourself to the issue to make it clear you're working on it).

After that, just work on it on a branch (containing your username) and create a Pull Request to the master branch when you're finished. Please assign me (@pklaschka) to review it and I'll take a look at it and (probably) merge it as soon as I can.
